config AW_SPINAND_PHYSICAL_LAYER
	bool
	help
	  Enable support for Allwinner's physical layer for spinand.
	  It's a command physical layer, used by both AW-nand with nftl and
	  MTD-nand with ubi.

config AW_SPINAND_SECURE_STORAGE
	bool
	help
	  Enable secure storage for Allwinner's spinand.

	  If unsure, say no.

config AW_SPINAND_PSTORE_MTD_PART
	bool "create pstore mtd partition for aw ubi spinand"
	depends on AW_MTD_SPINAND
	select MTD_PSTORE
	help
	  Whether create pstore mtd partition, which is need by pstroe-blk.
	  If you want linux kernel dump log to spinand when oops/panic, you
	  should create pstreo mtd partition by this configure.

	  If unsure, say no.

config AW_SPINAND_ENABLE_PHY_CRC16
	bool "check crc16 for each page on spinand physical layer"
	depends on AW_SPINAND_PHYSICAL_LAYER
	help
	  It is experimental.
	  To check crc16 for each page on spinand physical layer.

	  If unsure, say no.

config AW_SPINAND_SIMULATE_MULTIPLANE
	bool "enable simulate multiplane"
	depends on AW_SPINAND_PHYSICAL_LAYER
	default y
	help
	  spinand do not support multiplane. In order to adapt to aw nand
	  we simulate multiplane. If set, the common physical layer should
	  merge two continuous physical block to 'super block' for logical
	  layer.

	  Merge pages in two adjacent blocks with the same page num to super
	  page. Merge adjacent blocks to super block.

	  *   phy-block0   phy-block1    = super block 0
	  * |------------|------------|
	  * | phy-page 0 | phy-page 0 |  = super page 0 on super block 0
